# Mus505

This is the Stony Brook MUS505 desktop app.

This app will follow the course material of the Musicianship class as thaught by Prof. Perry Goldstein.

The goal is to provide an experience similar to the classroom lesson, in terms of ear training drills and ear-recognition exercises.
The material is ordered in units, which get incrementally more difficult and introduce new elements.


Ideated and coded by Alessandro Fadini with the assistance and guidance of the TLL (CELT). Special Thanks to Paul St-Denis.
